# CHALLENGE
# part 1 of 2 : 
write your own fetch and format method for a different recommendation
dataset. I used the last.fm dataset for song Artist Recommender : http://www.dtic.upf.edu/~ocelma/MusicRecommendationDataset/lastfm-360K.html
## Note: The dataset was very large (1.6 GB), So i used only first 100K 
# part 2 of 2 :
use 3 different loss functions (so 3 different models), compare results, print results for
#the best one. - Available loss functions are warp, logistic, bpr, and warp-kos.

# Usage
Just Run
